Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and\nsigns.\n\nIf you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain\ncalm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for\nhelp. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to\nshore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to\nswim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.",

Portions of Rhode Island,\nincluding the following areas, Bristol RI, Eastern Kent RI,\nNewport RI, Northwest Providence RI, Southeast Providence RI,\nWashington RI and Western Kent RI.\n\n* WHEN...From Wednesday morning through Thursday morning.\n\n* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of streets,\nurban areas, as well as low-lying, poor drainage and flood-prone\nlocations. The Wednesday afternoon commute may be impacted by\nheavy rain. Rapid-onset flash flooding is possible. Flooding may\nbe locally significant where persistent downpours develop and\nespecially areas that have seen severe flooding over the last 24\nto 48 hours. This includes the potential for water in homes and\nbusinesses, road washouts and structural damage. Small creeks and\nstreams may experience sharp rises to over bankfull.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...\n- Highly saturated conditions continue across much of Southern\nNew England, and some locations are still recovering from\nsevere flooding that occurred on Monday. A slow moving\nfrontal system moving in will bring another round of slow-\nmoving downpours and embedded thunderstorms from west to\neast. One to two inches of rain are forecast, although\nlocalized amounts up to four inches are possible. This will\nworsen existing flooding and/or trigger new areas of\nflooding.\n- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood",

Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and\nsigns.\n\nIf you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain\ncalm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for\nhelp. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to\nshore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to\nswim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.\n\nA High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in\nthe advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and\ndangerous swimming conditions.",
